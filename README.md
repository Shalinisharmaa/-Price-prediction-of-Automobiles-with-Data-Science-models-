# -Price-prediction-of-Automobiles-with-Data-Science-models-
Price prediction of Automobiles with Data Science models  This project will develop and evaluate a number of machine learning models for predicting used automobile prices. The research will make use of the comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, including a number of vehicle attributes like mileage, fuel type, engine specifications, and market trends. Key preprocessing steps included handling missing values, outlier removal, feature engineering, and data normalization. Various predictive models were applied in this study, comparing their performances: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression. The best performance amongst those is from the Random Forest model, with an R2 score of 0.63 and Mean Squared Error of 29.81. This project provides actionable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry and also showcases the effective usage of data science in real-world applications. Library, technology and tools used: - Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and statistical libraries, Data preprocessing, statistical analysis, visualization,
