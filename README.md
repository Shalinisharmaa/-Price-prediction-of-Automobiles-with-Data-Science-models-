# -Price-prediction-of-Automobiles-with-Data-Science-models-
Price prediction of Automobiles with Data Science models  This project will develop and evaluate a number of machine learning models for predicting used automobile prices. The research will make use of the comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, including a number of vehicle attributes like mileage, fuel type, engine specifications, and market trends. Key preprocessing steps included handling missing values, outlier removal, feature engineering, and data normalization. Various predictive models were applied in this study, comparing their performances: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression. The best performance amongst those is from the Random Forest model, with an R2 score of 0.63 and Mean Squared Error of 29.81. This project provides actionable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry and also showcases the effective usage of data science in real-world applications.

The price does not contain any null value in its column but it contains 0 values which can be said that the few vehicles are of no use or trash as it has a price value of 0 or any other reason that has not been confirmed yet. However, some of the analysis has been performed on the price here, so if the dataset is large, this bar graph represents the distribution of the cube roottransformed prices from a dataset as transformation using the cube root (np.cbrt) is commonly applied to reduce the skewness in highly skewed data, mostly in cases where there are extreme values. the first bar, which corresponds to the smallest price range (close to 0 after cube root transformation), has an exceptionally high frequency, nearing 40,000. This suggests that a large number of prices are either very low or clustered near a minimum value, which after transformation, appear in this first bar. Subsequently, another bar, representing slightly higher cube root price ranges (around 5, 10, 15, etc.), show progressively lower counts, generally between 5,000 and 10,000. This indicates that as the prices increase, even after transformation, fewer data points are falling into these higher ranges. This trend continues with frequencies dropping off further beyond the range of 25, where the counts diminish significantly, and the last visible bar (above 30) shows a minimal count close to zero. Despite the transformation, the distribution remains skewed to the right, meaning that most of the prices are still relatively low or closer to a baseline, with only a few prices extending into higher ranges. The transformation helps in spreading out the data, but the overall skewness indicates that the majority of prices are on the lower end. The skewness of the transformed data implies that in the original dataset, a majority of the prices are low, possibly representing a large quantity of vehicles that are more used and now can’t be used. The decline in frequency as prices increase suggests that high-priced vehicles are less common.

To address the missing values in the FuelType column, we will use the specific term "other". This will ensure that the word "other" appears in each blank row in the dataset. Since the car may operate on any fuel type other than those specified in the dataset such as natural gas, diesel, hybrid, or any other fuel type that is widely accessible on the market the word "other" should be filled in. The average data about the cars grouped by fuel type is shown to us in the bar graph. Different fuel types are represented by the X-axis, including Diesel, LPG, Plug-in Hybrid, Petrol, CNG, Electric, Hybrid, Hydrogen, and "other" (which probably refers to cars with less prevalent or unknown fuel types). The average cost of cars in each fuel type group is shown on the y-axis. Additionally, the average price of a specific fuel type is represented by each bar height; the higher the bar graph, the greater the average price. Let’s check which diesel vehicle uses the fuel with the highest average price across all categories for each fuel type, surpassing 5000 units (no specific currency). This implies that the average cost of diesel automobiles is higher than that of vehicles running on other fuels. Next in line is Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), which has the second-highest average price in the category, coming in just over 4000 units. This demonstrates that while LPG is pricey, it is not as costly as Diesel. Hybrid automobiles are more costly than traditional fuel vehicles, but less expensive than LPG and diesel, as seen by the moderately high average price of their plugins. CNG and petrol Vehicles powered by petrol and CNG are priced in the middle range, with typical costs hovering about 3000 per unit. These fuels are widely available and generally less costly than LPG and diesel. Hydrogen, Hybrid, and Electric These categories, all of which have average values below 3000 units, have the lowest prices overall. Despite their reputation for being more environmentally friendly, electric and hybrid cars seem to be more reasonably priced in this dataset. This might be due to lower entry-level prices or financial incentives. Vehicles classified as "other" include those with fuel kinds that are less prevalent or unclear. Its mid-range average price also suggests that this category is not very consistent. According to this graph, diesel is the most costly fuel on average, particularly when considering the cars’ market location, power, and economy. On the other hand, the cost of hydrogen and hybrid cars is lower; this may be due to their affordability or the market’s incentives for greener energy.

The interquartile range (IQR) represents the vast range suggesting the great variability in the price, while the median price is located in the middle of the box in the back, indicating that the price distribution is balanced. The 25th percentile begins at zero, which is lower, and the 75th percentile extends a greater value. The whiskers are fairly long, especially in the upward direction, indicating a wide variety of values, some of which are as high as 40 units.

Three different kinds of door configurations among the automobiles are shown by the dataset’s ’Doors’ column: ’04-May,’ ’02-Mar,’ and ’>5’. The range of vehicle designs in the dataset, each serving distinct market niches and customer tastes, is reflected in these categories. Handling Door Positions The most common door arrangement is the ’04-May’ group, which includes cars with four or five doors. With 76517 entries, this category contains the majority of the automobiles in the dataset. This category’s dominance can be linked to its representation of typical passenger cars, like sedans, SUVs, and hatchbacks. These vehicles types are very well known because they are valuable and have provided plenty of room for both passengers and baggage. As a result, they can be used for a variety of purposes, including family transportation and daily commuting. The popularity of four or five door cars emphasizes their status as the standard option for many buyers, demonstrating their wide appeal and adaptability in the automotive industry. In contrast, 3063 entries in the dataset belong to the ’02Mar’ category, which encompasses cars with two or three doors. Typically, smaller cars with this configuration are coupes and compact cars. Two or three door cars are less common, which indicates that their market niche is more specialized. Customers looking for sportier, more compact options or those who value style over utility frequently find these cars appealing. In contrast to the more adaptable four or five-door variants, these cars are less widespread, as seen by their reduced market share. With just 304 entries, the ‘>5’ door category which includes cars with more than five doors is the rarest. Larger cars, such as minivans, large SUVs, or specially built vehicles with specialized uses, are typically linked to this arrangement. This categorys ́ small number of cars reflects the specialized character of these models, which are frequently made for certain purposes like carrying large groups of people or offering extra utility through additional doors.
This box plot visualization representation is the spread and tendency of vehicle price across different door configurations using a minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It also highlights the range and any outliers.We have done this price of the vehicles measure along a continuous scale showing how prices vary across the different door types.

The next section we see is the gearbox; it has four options: Automatic, Tiptronic, Manual, Variator, and NaN. We have filled in the nan values with other options because they can be any type, such as Dual-clutch, Torque Converter, and Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). This allows us to add other options because each category now has a unique count: for automatic, the count is 66684, or 83.5 percent; for tiptronic, it is 6804, or roughly 8.5 percent; for manual, it is 4578, or 8.7 percent The box plot that is now displayed shows us how car costs are distributed across the many gearbox kinds, including "automatic," "manual," "variator," and "other." With a comprehensive picture of the spread, central tendency, and
price variability linked to each type of gearbox, this graphic sheds light on how these variables vary amongst the different categories. The interquartile range (IQR) for the GearBox for Tiptronic type is comparatively modest, suggesting that the core 50 percent of vehicle costs are tightly concentrated between around 15 and 25 units. This implies a modest level of price stability in this particular category. The line inside the box, as indicated by the median price, is almost equal to 20 units, indicating that half of the cars equipped with Tiptronic gears have cost less than this amount. There are a lot of outliers above the top whisker, which suggests that this category has some cars that are substantially more expensive.
Out of all the categories, the Automatic gearbox vehicle has the broadest IQR, with costs varying roughly between 5 and 20 units. The large range of vehicle models and specifications available with automatic transmissions may be the cause of the substantial price variability seen in this broad IQR within the automatic gearbox type. In comparison to Tiptronic and Variator gearboxes, the median price of this group is around 10 units, which is much lower and suggests a higher percentage of lesser-priced automobiles. The wide range of whiskers and the abundance of outliers, especially at the upper end, indicate that although there are many of affordable options, a small number of expensive cars tilt the price distribution upward.
The pricing cluster is closer in relation to the manual gearbox type than for automatic gearboxes. Their costs normally lie in the range unit of 10 to 15 units. An average cost of a manual car falls at about 13 units, between the automatic and tiptronic gearbox categories. Compared with the automatic gearboxes, there are fewer high-value outliers in the manual
32
gearboxes and also fewer complex outliers from both ends; this means that the usual usage of a manual transmission is for mid-range cars without such a huge price fluctuation. The gears in cars with variators which are frequently connected to CVTs, or continuously variable transmissions show a little higher median price than Tiptronic, suggesting that the middle of the vehicle price range for this category is higher.
With a narrower IQR, prices appear to be closely clustered around the median for Variator gearboxes, indicating lower fluctuation and a more consistent pricing trend within this gearbox type. While the most of prices are closely clustered, there are still a few exceptions with higher pricing; these are the few high-priced outliers in comparison to Tiptronic and Automatic.
Other gearbox vehicles have fewer frequent or unknown gearbox types, and their flat boxes and extremely small spreads suggest that there is little to no difference in pricing. This may indicate that there are few and similarly priced automobiles in the ’other’ category. This might be the result of a small sample size for the data or a highly specialised market sector with consistent pricing. There are no anomalies, which further suggests that prices are consistent for this category thus, in general, the box plot illustrates unique price features related to each type of gearbox. Automatic gearbox vehicles have the greatest price variety, indicating that they serve a wide range of market groups, from entry-level to luxury. Manual and variator gearboxes, on the other hand, show more consistent pricing patterns within these categories with more moderate cost and less variety.

"A time series is a collection of data points indexed in time order. Each data point represents a measurement taken at a specific time, and the sequence in which these points occur is essential for analysis. The data points are typically collected from a regular interval e.g., yearly, monthly, or daily, allowing for the analysis of how the values change over time. Time series data is necessary for identifying trends, patterns, seasonal variations, and other behaviours that are critical for making forecasts and informed decisions". In time series data it employs specialized statistical techniques to model and generate future predictions effectively. So this chart shows us that a time series is a sequence of data points gathered or recorded at successive points in time, often with equal intervals between them. The unique aspect of a time series lies in its order. The data points cannot be rearranged or shuffled without losing the essential time-related insights. The sequence from 2004 to 2020 captures how car sales prices evolve year by year, allowing us to observe patterns like trends or fluctuations that would have been lost if the data points were not ordered. "Average Price," with a scale ranging approximately. This component of the series rep- resents the average car sales price. Each point on the graph compares to the average car sales price in a given year. These points are connected by a line to show the trend over time. Each point in the graph corresponds to the average car sales price for a specific year. Connecting these points with a line helps us to visualize the overall trend and the changes from one year to the next. This line makes it easy to see whether price prediction is generally increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating. The light blue area around the line represents the certainty to the interval, which indicates the variability in the data. A wider coloured area indicates higher variability, suggesting less confidence in the average value, while a narrower shaded area suggests more stability and confidence in the average estimates. From 2004 to 2020, the chart shows a clear downfall trend in average car sales prices. This downward movement suggests a consistent decrease in prices over the years. Understanding all these trends is important for collaborater in the automotive industry, as it might affect pricing strategies or production planning, and market positioning too. There was a gradual decline in prices, indicating the onset of a downward trend in the years 2004 to 2007. Then in 2008 Significant Drop This sharp decline likely aligned with the global financial crisis, which severely impacted economic activities worldwide, including the automotive market. The crisis led to a decrease in the demand, impacting car prices seriously. From 2008 to 2010 there was a slight rise that was helpful. This could reflect market adjustments and post-crisis as the conditions began to stabilize in that. From 2010 Onwards there was a Gradual Decline After the short recovery, the prices continued declining gradually with minor fluctuations. This
gradual decline suggests a constant downward pressure on car prices, potentially it is due to factors like increased competition in the industry, changes in consumer choices, technological progress, or due to financial conditions. From 2018 to 2020 there was a deep decline The most fall occurred after 2018, extending into 2020. This sharper drop might be linked to recent troubles, such as economic downfall in the market dynamics, like the increased focus on electric vehicles or other technological shifts. Overall, This time series chart effectively captures all the downward trends or upward trends in average car sales prices from 2004 to 2020, providing insights into how the market has evolved over the years. The sequence and connection of data points highlight the importance of ordering in time series data, making it possible to observe trends, fluctuations, and potential causes of these changes.

The linear regression model is used to create a model that describes the relationship between a dependent variable and depending on one or more independent variables a difference is made between simple and multiple linear regression.[20] The simple linear regression aims to analyse the influence of an independent variable on one dependent variable. The goal of simple linear regression is to predict the value of a dependent variable based on an independent variable. The greater the linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, the more accurate and proper the prediction is. This goes along with the fact that the greater the proportion of the dependent variable’s variance that can be explained by the independent variable, the more accurate is the prediction to determine this straight line, linear regression uses the method of least squares. The regression line can be described by the following equation:" y = α + βx where the explanation of this is
• beta = slope
• alpha = yintercept 
• y = y coordinate
• x = xcoordinate
The scatter plot before hypertuning or adjusting visualizes the relationship between actual and predicted prices in the context of a simple linear regression model. Here x - axis has true values, y - axis has predicted values.The data point in which we have blue circles represents an individual observation that is data point the position of each point indicates the actual and predicted price. In this, the points are scattered which means the prediction has bit errors.
The above scatter plot after hypertuning The adjustment appears to have mainly shifted the predicted values closer to the red line. The intercept adjustment typically shifts the predicted values up or down without changing their slope or relative positions. The shift (represented by the orange points) suggests a minor improvement in aligning the predictions with the actual values, particularly in regions where actual prices are higher. The adjusted model (orange points) shows a slight improvement in terms of predictions being closer to the red line, especially in the middle range of actual prices. The intercept adjustment made a modest improvement in aligning predictions with actual values, but the model’s overall performance remains limited.
Further, we have a visualization of the Q-Q plot, Q-Q plots are used for several important statistical reasons.
The x-axis represents theoretical quantiles, while the y-axis shows sample quantiles. The blue dots represent individual data points. The red line is a reference line, typically
representing the line y=x. The data perfectly followed the theoretical distribution, all points would fall exactly on this line. The plot compares the sample data (residuals) distribution to a theoretical normal distribution. The blue dots generally follow the red reference line, suggesting that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. The plot is symmetrical around the origin (0,0), indicating that the residuals are centred around zero, which is desirable for regression residuals. There are slight deviations at both ends of the plot The lower tail shows some points falling below the line. The upper tail shows some points above the line. These deviations suggest that the actual distribution has slightly heavier tails than a perfectly normal distribution. This Q-Q plot suggests that the residuals are reasonably well-approximated by a normal distribution, with only minor deviations in the tails. This is generally considered acceptable for most statistical analyses that assume the normality of residuals. However, if extreme precision is required, the slight heavy-tailedness might be worth not much. Middle range: The middle part of the plot, actually everything between -2 and 2 on both axes, fits very well to the normal distribution. Indeed, not much of an S-shape or any other pattern can be seen; this is a good sign for my data. It means, in this linear regression, Mean Squared Error is the average of the squared difference between the true prices and the predicted values. This MSE here is 1.00, which means the average of the errors after being squared is 1, meaning that the predictions are still relatively close to the actual values, though there is still a sign for an improvement on this part. As we know, the lower the MSE, the better the output, especially for a simple linear regression model. The model provides useful predictions. The R-squared (R2) score of 0.33 means that 33% of the variability in actual prices is explained by the model. While an R2 score of 1 indicates perfect prediction, an R2 score of 0.33 shows that the model has captured an important relationship between the features and the target variable (price).

I have used random forest and decision tree, trying another model to satisfy the results. [13]The decision tree represents a flexible machine learning approach with wide applications in both classification and regression. It is easy to comprehend because it describes choices and their probable results in a graphical form showing the tree structure. Each internal node in the tree represents a feature or characteristic; each branch then represents a decision rule or test condition involving that feature every leaf node represents a result, or a prediction. The decision tree operates by recursively dividing the data into subsets based on feature values that best divide the data points. The algorithm will always choose, at every split, the characteristic that maximizes information gain or minimizes uncertainty. This process is repeated until a stopping criterion, such as a maximum tree depth or a minimum number of samples in a leaf, is met. The R square for the decision tree is DecisionTreeRegressor - Mean Squared Error is 44.98 DecisionTreeRegressor
-R
- square Score: 0.44
An ensemble learning technique called Random Forest is mostly applied to regression and classification problems. During training, a large number of decision trees are built, for classification or for the average prediction for regression of each individual tree output. Random Forests are less inclined to overfitting than single decision trees because they combine the ideas of bagging Bootstrap Aggregation and random feature selection. Bootstrapping: To generate several training sets, Random Forests employ the bootstrapping approach. To create a fresh training set for every tree, N randomly picked samples are substituted from the original dataset. This implies that although some samples could show up several times in a training set, others might not show up at all. Random Feature Selection: Random Forests 
randomly choose a subset of features for each split in a decision tree, and only the best feature from this subset is utilised to divide the node. Adding more randomness ensures that there is no correlation between the trees in the forest, which strengthens generalisation. For random forest the mathematical formulation is Let X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} be the dataset with correspondinglabelsY ={y1,y2,...,yn}.Foreachtreeintheforest,abootstrappedsubsetof X is used to train the tree. The following steps are involved:
